# polybar-scripts

This is a community project. We collect scripts for polybar!


To find out how to write and use your own scripts, read the [polybar wiki](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/wiki). This repository is not an exact blueprint. I guess every script has to be customized to make your polybar unique.

Yours isn't here? Send us your pull request.
